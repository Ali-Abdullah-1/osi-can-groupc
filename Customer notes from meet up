This are summarized dates and notes from the check-ins we had with the clients(customer)

On the 24-09-2025

We met Juliius a representative of OSCI-CAN for the first time and got to understand a little of what they want and what they are trying to achieve.

The major points gotten which are listed below:

1.) The website needed to be more user friendly

2.) It needs to be less congested and more organized

3.) It needs to target the major demographic

This was all information gotten from the first meeting

In the next meeting which was on the 01-10-2025

The were not much said by the user because what we mosty showed were low fidelity prototypes for the website

But the clients loved the idea of annonymous donations and he was surprised that users could not donate without realeasing information

Also brooklyn a memeber in the meeting give a suggestion on  removing one of our low fidelity protoype due to the absense of program on the navigation bar.

This was all information gotten from the second meeting
